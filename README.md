<p>Note1 : I have used a public api for getting all details about github repos , the api data doesn't include picture so i used unsplash url api to get random picture<p/>
<p>Note2 : the search apply on the repo name<p/>
<p>Note3 : I have used the concept of seperating the logic from view , because it's considered as a best practice</p>
